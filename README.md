# üö¶ Road Signs Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## üìÑ Overview
This project focuses on building a robust image classification model to recognize and classify road signs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). By training the model on a labeled dataset of traffic sign images, the system aims to support real-time applications in autonomous driving and traffic monitoring systems.

## üéØ Objectives
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, resize, and normalize image data for optimal model performance.  
- **Model Architecture Design**: Build a CNN tailored for multi-class image classification.  
- **Training & Evaluation**: Train the model using labeled images and evaluate performance with metrics like accuracy and loss.  
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Enable classification of new road sign images for real-world use.  
- **Deployment Ready**: Prepare the model for integration into real-time systems or mobile/web applications.  

## üîç Key Highlights
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved excellent classification accuracy using deep CNN architecture.  
- **Multi-Class Problem**: Model trained to identify and distinguish between numerous road sign categories.  
- **Augmentation Techniques**: Improved generalization using rotation, zoom, flipping, and shifting.  
- **Real-World Application**: Applicable to ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) and autonomous vehicles.  

## üìä Data Features
The dataset includes:
- **Image Files**: RGB images of road signs (various classes like speed limits, warnings, prohibitions).  
- **Labels**: Corresponding class identifiers for each image.  
- **Image Size**: Standardized dimensions (e.g., 32x32 or 64x64 pixels) for CNN input.  
- **Classes**: Multiple traffic sign types (e.g., Stop, Yield, Speed Limit, No Entry, etc.).  

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for model development.  
- **Deep Learning Libraries**: `TensorFlow`, `Keras` for CNN modeling.  
- **Image Processing**: `OpenCV`, `PIL` for data loading and augmentation.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and visual tracking of training progress.  

## üöÄ Impact
- **Road Safety**: Aids in automated detection of signs to support driver alerts and vehicle automation.  
- **AI in Transportation**: Contributes to the development of intelligent transport systems.  
- **Scalability**: Can be extended for real-time mobile or vehicle-based deployment.
